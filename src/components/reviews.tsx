          A personable look at a fascinating life. The author lets us in to his
          unique journey from childhood to parenthood, from student to
          professional, from his native land to several places outside his
          country. It is motivational with many examples of overcoming
          challenges. If you&apos;re looking for an easy read with rich cultural
          references to African history, specifically Nigeria, then this book is
          for you. Uukwu, Amazon verified purchase.
